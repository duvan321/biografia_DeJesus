- 🙎‍♂️ Here I tell you a little about how I have developed this page: :

- in the html
  first use a section tag
  inside create a header tag with header, then use a "main" tag for the main page,
  in the center of the page use another
  section tag and at the end a footer. and saw with the section.

- In css I gave styles to the tags to the body I gave it a margin of 30 px,
  to Section a background color of darkgoldenrod,
  to the header a background color of black to the main a flexible display to
  give flexibility to the paragraphs and the image and to the section for the video
  I gave another magin of 30px and to the footer a colored background and a color
  for the title I also used mediaqueris so that can be viewed on smaller screens.
